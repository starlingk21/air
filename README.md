# airBaltic application

## Project setup
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

## Packages and other used materials
- `Nuxt3`
- `Typescript`
- `sass` - styling, mixins for vue components.
- `@nuxt/image` = for image optimization in nuxt
- `tailwind` - styling
- `pinia` - state management
- `zod` - validation
- `@nuxtjs/google-fonts` - Proper font usage for the project

### Multiple things I would do if would have more time
- Fix all the styling bugs
- If design would be available, - implement tablet view
- Create (atleast empty) pages for routing and testing
- Mobile navigation implementation
- Breadcrumbs with real routes
- For flight dates proper dates validation and saving in the state
- Possibly missed places to use tailwind.
- Bugfix in the footer for the newsletter (missing icon)

Probably there are many more things like cypress and other things which can be drastically improved, but tried to make the best I could in the time I had.

- Total time spent 2 days (around 18 hours)
- No previous knowledge in Zod and lack of experience with tailwind.
- Tried to follow the best practices, including the screen readers attributes.
